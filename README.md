# Dynamic Restaurant Ordering and Payment System

An interactive, responsive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows customers to browse a digital menu, select items, and dynamically calculate costs, including taxes, and generate a digital receipt. This project focuses on creating a seamless, user-friendly interface for an enhanced customer experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Menu**: Includes categories like **Breakfast**, **Lunch**, **Dinner**, **Snacks**, and **Beverages**. Customers can browse items and select quantities for their order.
- **Dynamic Cost Calculation**: Calculates total costs based on user selections, including **GST** (Goods and Services Tax). The system instantly updates the price when quantities are adjusted.
- **Digital Payment Receipt**: A detailed receipt is generated upon checkout, displaying itemized costs, taxes, and payment details, all within the web interface.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user interactions, dynamic cost calculation, and receipt generation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CHIDARISAIKRISHNA/Restaurant-Website
    ```

2. Navigate to the Project Folder:
```bash
cd Restaurant-Website
```
3. Open the Project:<br>
To open the index.html file, run the following command based on your operating system:<br>
 For macOS:
  ```bash
 open index.html
```
 For Linux:
  ```bash
 xdg-open index.html
```
 For Windows:
  ```bash
start index.html

```

## How It Works

1. **Menu Selection**: Users can browse the categories and select items they wish to order. They can specify the quantity of each item in the input field next to the item's name.
2. **Cost Calculation**: When the user adjusts the quantity of any item, the total cost, including applicable taxes (e.g., GST), is updated dynamically.
3. **Receipt Generation**: After the selection process, clicking the "Calculate" button displays a detailed receipt in a separate section, outlining the itemized costs, total tax, and the final amount to be paid.

## Project Goals

- Create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that enhances the customer experience.
- Provide real-time feedback for customers regarding their selections and total costs.
- Ensure responsive design for a smooth experience across all devices.

## Future Enhancements

- **Payment Integration**: Plan to integrate online payment methods (e.g., credit card, UPI) for complete transaction flow.
- **User Accounts**: Add user accounts to save previous orders and allow order tracking.
- **Admin Panel**: Create an admin interface for restaurant staff to manage menu items and view customer orders in real-time.
